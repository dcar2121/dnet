Glossary of Key Terms
Entity-Relationship (ER) Model Terms
	•	Users: Individuals or entities interacting with the system, performing transactions.
	•	Assets: Financial instruments or holdings supporting tranches, characterized by attributes like name, type, and value.
	•	Tranches: Segments of an asset categorized by risk level, interest rate, and total value.
	•	Transactions: User-initiated actions such as deposits, withdrawals, or rebalancing, recorded with details like amount and date.
	•	ValidationMetrics: Data collected from off-chain sources (oracles, sensors), including transmission loss, spectrum, and signal strength, used to validate transactions.
	•	Oracles: External data providers supplying validation metrics to the blockchain.
	•	TransactionValidation: The process and record of validating a transaction, including validity status, time, and associated metrics.
Psi (Ψ) System Terms
	•	Ψ (Psi): A metric representing signal or transmission quality, used to quantify transmission efficacy.
	•	Transmission Loss: The reduction in signal power during transmission, affecting data integrity.
	•	Spectrum: The range of frequencies used for communication; monitoring spectrum ensures optimal data transmission.
	•	Signal Strength: The power level of the received signal, indicating transmission quality.
	•	Validation Metrics: Data points such as Ψ, transmission loss, spectrum, and signal strength, used to assess transmission reliability.
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model
	•	OSI Model: A conceptual framework that standardizes communication functions into seven layers, facilitating interoperability.
	•	Physical Layer: Handles the physical transfer of raw data bits.
	•	Data Link Layer: Manages node-to-node data transfer and error detection.
	•	Network Layer: Routes data packets across networks.
	•	Transport Layer: Ensures complete data transfer with error recovery.
	•	Session Layer: Manages sessions between applications.
	•	Presentation Layer: Translates data formats and handles encryption and compression.
	•	Application Layer: Provides services directly to end-user applications.

# --- Example Usage in Script ---

# Function to display current transmission metrics
def display_transmission_metrics(psi_value, transmission_loss, spectrum_range, signal_strength):
    print(f"Ψ (Psi) - Signal Quality Metric: {psi_value}")
    print(f"Transmission Loss: {transmission_loss} dB")
    print(f"Spectrum Range: {spectrum_range} Hz")
    print(f"Signal Strength: {signal_strength} dBm")

# Function to validate a transaction based on transmission metrics
def validate_transaction(transaction_id, psi, transmission_loss, signal_strength):
    # Simplified validation logic
    if psi > 0.8 and transmission_loss < 3 and signal_strength > -70:
        validation_status = "Valid"
    else:
        validation_status = "Invalid"
    print(f"Transaction {transaction_id} validation status: {validation_status}")
    # Log validation metrics
    log_validation_metrics(transaction_id, psi, transmission_loss, signal_strength, validation_status)

def log_validation_metrics(transaction_id, psi, transmission_loss, signal_strength, status):
    # Here you'd save to a database or blockchain
    print(f"Logging metrics for transaction {transaction_id}:")
    print(f"Ψ: {psi}, Loss: {transmission_loss} dB, Signal: {signal_strength} dBm, Status: {status}")

# Example data input
display_transmission_metrics(0.9, 2.5, 1800000000, -65)
validate_transaction("tx123", 0.9, 2.5, -65)
