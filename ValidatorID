# Proof of Concept Algorithm for D Network 

# This project implements a Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanism suitable for a decentralized network (D network). It features a deterministic validator ID generation based on static, coherence, and transmission signals, enhancing security and dynamic validator identity management.

## Overview

PoA is a consensus protocol where a set of trusted validators produce and validate blocks. This implementation:
- Uses cryptographic signatures from validators.
- Generates validator IDs dynamically based on specific signals.
- Supports validator set management via governance.

---

## Features

- **Deterministic Validator IDs**: Generated from static, coherence, and transmission signals.
- **Secure Block Signing**: Validators sign blocks with their private keys.
- **Validator Management**: Easy addition/removal of validators through governance.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Suitable for permissioned or semi-permissioned networks.

## Validator ID Generation

Each validator's ID is generated as follows:
- **Validator1**: 0ff65141985399d7bba13a11b84285a99c102edcf34153bc2b64eddb8d219d41,
- **Validator2**: 12c1f51cf0196e9b8ee403ab1a595184d712bbdeff3007b7411d23fb46669bb7,
- **Validator3**: 02e5cf5fd99db86009ce2877e130891e20a64daeca0beba97c31f41a818943c6,
- **Validator4**: 12c1f51cf0196e9b8ee403ab1a595184d712bbdeff3007b7411d23fb46669bb7,
- **Validator5**: 0ff65141985399d7bba13a11b84285a99c102edcf34153bc2b64eddb8d219d41,
